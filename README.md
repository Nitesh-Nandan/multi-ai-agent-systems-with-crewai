```

## üõ†Ô∏è Utility Functions (`utils.py`)

The `utils.py` file contains helper functions and classes that support the main lesson implementations:

- **API Key Management**: Functions to retrieve and validate API keys
- **SKU Findability System**: Example data management classes
- **Helper Functions**: Utility functions for common operations

## üîß Running the Examples

### Individual Execution

Each Python file can be run independently:

```bash
# Run L2 (Article Writing)
python src/L2_research_write_article.py

# Run L3 (Customer Support)
python src/L3_customer_support.py

# Run L4 (Customer Outreach)
python src/L4_tools_customer_outreach.py

# Run L5 (Event Planning)
python src/L5_tasks_event_planning.py
```

### Interactive Usage

Import and use functions in your own code:

```python
# Import specific functions
from L2_research_write_article import create_agents, create_tasks

# Create agents and tasks
planner, writer, editor = create_agents()
plan_task, write_task, edit_task = create_tasks(planner, writer, editor)

# Use them in your own crew
from crewai import Crew
crew = Crew(agents=[planner, writer, editor], tasks=[plan_task, write_task, edit_task])
```

## üìö Learning Path

### Beginner Level
1. Start with **L2** to understand basic concepts
2. Study agent creation and task definition
3. Run examples and experiment with parameters

### Intermediate Level
1. Move to **L3** for advanced agent features
2. Explore tool integration and memory
3. Understand agent cooperation patterns

### Advanced Level
1. Study **L4** for custom tool creation
2. Master **L5** for advanced task features
3. Combine concepts from all lessons

## üéØ Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Each lesson is self-contained with clear separation of concerns
- Functions are well-documented with docstrings
- Error handling and validation are included
- Configuration is separated from logic

### Agent Design
- Define clear roles, goals, and backstories
- Use appropriate delegation settings
- Implement proper tool assignments
- Consider memory requirements

### Task Configuration
- Set clear expected outputs
- Use appropriate task dependencies
- Implement human input when needed
- Structure outputs for consistency

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Errors**
   - Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured
   - Check that API keys are valid and have sufficient credits

2. **Import Errors**
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
   - Check Python path and virtual environment

3. **Tool Errors**
   - Ensure tools are properly configured
   - Check API rate limits and quotas

### Debug Mode

Most functions include verbose logging. Enable it by setting `verbose=True` in agent and crew configurations.
